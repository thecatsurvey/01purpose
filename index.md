Why this site exists.

This website / code collection was started on a whim.

Once upon a time in the year 2000 a team of other talented people and me worked together at Zagat Survey at 4 Columbus Circle. We were at the height of the dot-com bubble, and located just across the street from the beginnings of what would become Time Warner Center, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center and some of the most valuable real estate in Manhattan.

At the time, are raison d'etre was to publish a book about New York City restaurants base on a yearly poll from voters, called Zagat Survey. Then in 2001, the dotcom bubble burst. People were laid-off and the Twin Towers fell on September 11th.

Fast-forward to today, June 15, 2022. 21 years have passed, and my friends from decades ago are looking back on our experience, what happened and what could have happened. Welcome to The Cat Survey, a tribute to our former employer. (Zagat rhymes with cat). -- RL
